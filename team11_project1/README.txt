To run the program(python 2.7):
	- open linux command line, nagivate to the folder which contains both this 
	  README and team11_project1.py (as well as some test and example files)
	- enter 'python team11_project1.py -i <inputfilename> -o <outputfilePrefix>
	- the program will read the input file and produce two output files:
		outputfilePrefix_dis.txt, and
		outputfilePrefix_sim.txt
	- test* files were provided, example* files were generated using test1_bin.txt.

Enjoy.
